## Mute Points are being added if a player has been muted, here you can configurate the value of the mute time of a player
## If a player has been muted for Spamming the normal duration is 1200 seconds = 20 minutes and he has been added 1 mute point
## If a player now has 1 mute point, the duration is being multiplied with 1.5 so: 1200 * 1.5 = 1800 seconds equals 30 minutes
## If a player now has 4 mute points, the duration is being multiplied with 2 so: 1200 * 2 = 2400 seconds equals 40 minutes
## If the value is set to -1, the player will be permanently muted
